            <h3>A Radio Frequency (RF) and Microwave center for research has been set up at the institute with the focus of working on Antenna Design & Fabrication. This center is concerned with the analysis, design and synthesis of Antennae using micro and Nanotechnology for both search and tracking applications. In this center, design and fabrication of ANTENNA is being explored which is a challenging task, due to the optical property of metal which are significantly different from the microwave characteristics.</h3>
